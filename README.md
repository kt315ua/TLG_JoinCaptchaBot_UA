## Sync forked master branch with origin master repo

1. Add the remote (original repo that you forked) and call it “upstream”

        git remote add upstream git@github.com:J-Rios/TLG_JoinCaptchaBot.git

2. Fetch all branches of remote upstream

        git fetch upstream

3. Rewrite your master with upstream’s master using git rebase.

        git rebase upstream/master

4. Push your updates to master. You may need to force the push with “--force”.

        git push origin master --force
